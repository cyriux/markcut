markcut
=======

A plain text ascii editor to create files ready for laser cutting without spending time on vector design software.

You draw like this, with even parameters:
<pre>
^ +-------+
a | |
+ +---+ +---+
3 | |
v +-------+
< 7 + 5 + 7 >
parameters:
a = 12
</pre>

Then you get the .svg file ready to send to the laser-cutter!
